Through Refigure, Rifa-Thorpe Tracey provides tailor-made mentoring and meditation services for individuals and teams, corporates and non-profits.

At the start of my short ten-day engagement, I proposed three possible design directions. Based on the discussion and feedback these generated, I was able to create a logo and associated brand collateral and guidelines, as well as envisage the design of an Android app that could bring Rifa’s unique style and flexible learning programme to a global audience.

At the heart of Refigure’s brand is the monogram. A scripted ‘r’ within a slanted oval, provides a personal touch to the company’s brand, subtly hinting at ideas of growth, renewal and continuous improvement. A high contrast complementary palette of dark warm purple and a vibrant green gave the brand an energetic yet approachable feel, while a series of thematic icons primarily composed using a single line that drew inspiration from the scripted logo mark.
